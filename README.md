In this article we investigated the effect of higher-order dispersion on ultrafast photoionisation. In order to do that we first needed to generate waveforms of ultrafast pulses shaped with higher-order dispersions. This is what the *Waveform.m* Octave script does.

#Basic usage for Waveform.m
The properties of the waveform must be defined. The laser intensity is determined by the 'Intensity' variable (line 9) in unit of $\frac{W}{cm^2}$.
