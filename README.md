In this article we investigated the effect of higher-order dispersion on ultrafast photoionisation. In order to do that we first needed to generate waveforms of ultrafast pulses shaped with higher-order dispersions. This is what the *Waveform.m* Octave script calculates.

# Basic usage of Waveform.m
The properties of the incoming ultrafast laser pulse must be defined:<br>
1. The laser intensity is determined by the 'Intensity' variable (line 9) in units of $\frac{W}{cm^2}$.
2. The intensity full width at half maximum (FWHM) is defined by the 'PulseWidth' variable (line 10) in units of femtoseconds (fs).<br>
3. The central wavelength is defined by the 'Wavelength' variable (line 11) in units of nanometers.
4. The carrier-envelope phase (CEP) is defined by the vector 'CEP_value' (line 6) in units of degrees. Example: if the vector contains the values '0', '120', and '240', it means the script calculates these three CEP values.
5. The values of the higher-order dispersion is given by the vector 'value'. Similarly to the CEP values, the code calculates with all the dispersion values given by the vector 'value'. The type of higher-order dispersion is defined by the 'GDD = value(i_Dispersion);' command (line 19). There are three different types of higer-order dispersion this code can calculate, namely the second-order dispersion or group-delay dispersion (GDD), third-order dispersion (TOD), or fourth-order dispersion (FOD). If we replace the 'GDD' in the command line to 'TOD' or 'FOD', the script will calculate the TOD and FOD respectively with the values given by the 'value' vector. The code calculates first the Gaussian transform-limited pulse, with the given intensity, FWHM, central wavelength and CEP values, than it calculates the pulses shaped with higher-order dispersion(s) according to the chapter 'The theory of dispersion' in the above mentioned article. The code writes out only the temporal profile(s) of the ultrashort pulses that were shaped with higher-order dispersion.<br>
## Invoking the script
The script is written in Octave programming language and therefore requires an Octave interpreter. The code can be invoked with the source('Waveform.m') command.
## Output files generated by Waveform.m
The script generates four types of output files. The names of the files are containig the properties of the ultrashort laser pulse.<br>
1. The names of the text files consisting the temporal profile of the electric field have the following form: 'waveForm_1e+15Wcm_7fs_0CEP_0GDD_90TOD_0FOD.txt'. It means this file contains the temporal profile of the pulse that was shaped with $0 fs^2$ GDD, $0 fs^4$ FOD, and $90 fs^3$ FOD. The incoming, or transform-limited pulse has an intensity of $10^{15}\frac{W}{cm^2}$ intensity, 7 fs FWHM, and 0 degrees of CEP. These text files consists of three columns. The first column stands for the time, the second stands for the real part of the electric field, and the third column means the absolute value of the electric field. The measurement unit is given by (Hartree) atomic units. The number of waveForm text files are equal with the number of CEP values in the 'CEP_value' vector multiplied with the number of higher-order dispersion values in the 'value' vector.<br>

2. The names of .jpg files showing the temporal profile of the electric field has the following form: 'Graph_1e+15Wcm_7fs_0CEP0GDD_90TOD_0FOD.jpg'. Apart from the CEP, the file name contains the properties of the pulse it depicts, similarly to the previous one. The depicted electric fields have 0 degree CEP values and therefore the number of files are equal with the number of dispersion values in the 'value' vector.<br>

3. The names of the text files consisting the Wigner function of the ultrashort laser pulse have the following form:'Wigner_1e+15Wcm_7fs_0GDD_0TOD_500FOD.txt'. The file name contains the properties of the pulse, and the number of text files containing the Wigner distributions are equal with the number of dispersion values in the 'value' vector. Theese text files consists of three columns. The first column stands for the time, the second stands for the angular frequency, and the third column stands for the values of the Wigner function. The measurement unit is given by (Hartree) atomic units.<br>

4. The names of .jpg files showing the Wigner function of the ultrashort laser pulse have the following form: 'Wigner_1e+15Wcm_7fs_0GDD_0TOD_500FOD.jpg'. The file name contains the properties of the pulse it depicts, and the number of .jpg files containing the Wigner distributions are equal with the number of dispersion values in the 'value' vector.

# The CTMC_RKPD_SCR_OMP_CPP_GDD.cpp file
The CTMC_RKPD_SCR_OMP_CPP_GDD.cpp is a code to simulate ionization processes induced with ultrashort laser pulses with the classical-trajectory Monte Carlo method.
